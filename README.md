# GeneralisedCharacterInteractor
An object oriented python script for simulating very broad and generalised interactions between characters. This script may be useful as a foundation for building more complex interaction systems on top of. This script assumes that disposition can be transitioned along a number line and that each character will have their own perception of other characters and the behavior of other characters. To run the script, execute EAIMain.py. CharacterList.txt is where character definitions are stored with the initial settings for each character on each new line. Documentation.txt has an overview of the logic behind this script.
